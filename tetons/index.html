        <h1>The Grand Tetons National Park Mobile App Redesign</h1>
        <p>
          For my DGM 2270 class we were tasked with the redesign of a national
          parks website. In 2019 I went backpacking in the Grand Tetons with my
          Dad and that inspired me to redesign the site for The Grand Teton
          National Park. The National Parks are beautiful, inspiring locations
          that are ideally easily accessible to the public. In the same vein, an
          app for navigating the parks should be easily accessible and user
          friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          My objective was to create a mobile app that is simple, intuitive, and
          extremely easy to use. The typical user I had in mind ranged from the
          quick, on-the-go, youthful hiker to the older explorer just trying to
          enjoy the nature around them. Both would need an easy to use
          interface.
        </p>
        <img
          src="tetons-site.png"
          alt="tetons site"
          width="400px"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          I recognized that I would need to include all that is most important
          on the original site, so I headed over to the url
          https://www.nps.gov/grte/index.htm that would simply explain the
          required features of a national parks app. I noted the alerts tab,
          which I hadn’t considered before, and I thought about the need for the
          ability to reserve campgrounds and obtain permits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I next did some sketches of what would make for a good national parks
          mobile app. I opted towards the use of icons to make each action that
          can be taken to be clear and obvious. A couple iterations got me where
          I needed to be.
        </p>
        <img
          src="final-app.png"
          alt="final app design"
          width="700px"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          Finally I created my designs in Figma. They turned out clear,
          user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. I strive to make them from
          the perspective of a hiker who needs simple and clear information at a
          glance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned the importance of doing your research and getting
          inspiration from similar sources. I learned the value of sketching
          beforehand. I also learned how to view things from the user’s
          perspective. I encourage other UX designers to do the same.
