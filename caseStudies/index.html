        <h2>Case Study 2: Carnelian Water Services Site</h2>
        <p>
          Carnelian Water Services is a site for my Dad&#39;s new company. He is
          offering the service of providing salt pallets to replace the used
          ones for people&#39;s salt water softening system.
        </p>
        <img
          class="left"
          src="../images/caseStudy/CWS-Sketches.png"
          alt="CWS Flyer 1"
          width="300px"
          height="auto"
        />

        <p>
          The project needed to happen to publicize my Dad&#39;s new water
          softening company online. He will be able to use QR codes to share his
          site quickly and easily. It needs to show what services he provides at
          what cost.
        </p>
        <img
          class="right"
          src="../images/caseStudy/CWS-Styles.png"
          alt="CWS Flyer 1"
          width="500px"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          The user of his website would be the old woman who doesn&#39;t have
          the strength to lift the heavy salt pallets alone. It could also be
          the dad who wants a break from the arduous task of replacing salt
          pallets.
        </p>
        <img
          class="left"
          src="../images/caseStudy/CWS-Outfit.png"
          alt="CWS Flyer 1"
          width="300px"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          I coded the website and came up with some of the design ideas. My
          cousin Brett was the graphic designer and made the logo and an idea of
          what the home page of the website would look like.
        </p>
        <img
          class="right"
          src="../images/caseStudy/CWS-Site.png"
          alt="CWS Flyer 1"
          width="500px"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          My dad needed me to get the site done before late December so he could
          publicize his services as a potential Christmas gift. I also was very
          overwhelmed and busy with my classes at the time. I also had never
          coded a website for a company before and my skills only include coding
          in HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript at that point.
        </p>
        <img
          class="left"
          src="../images/caseStudy/CWS-Flyer1.png"
          alt="CWS Flyer 1"
          width="300px"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          First I went over the site and company idea with my dad. I got clarity
          on what he wanted to get out of having a website and who his ideal
          customer was. We then did some sketches together to map out the
          information hierarchy.
        </p>
        <img
          class="right"
          src="../images/caseStudy/CWS-Flyer2.png"
          alt="CWS Flyer 1"
          width="300px"
          height="auto"
        />
        <p>
          Next I communicated with my cousin Brett, the graphic designer for
          this project, to see what kind of design, font, and color scheme he
          was going for. After that I started coding the site. I used examples
          of other sites for good navigation design, FAQ designs, and pricing
          table designs. In the end the site was ready to deploy to its already
          purchased domain. I even helped my dad make flyers with the site QR
          code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately my dad hasn&#39;t moved forward with his business with
          great effort yet. He had some additional tweaks he wanted to make to
          the site, but overall it&#39;s a very functional and visually pleasing
          site.
